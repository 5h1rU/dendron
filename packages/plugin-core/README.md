> "We are overwhelmed with information and we don't have the tools to properly index and filter through it. [The development of these tools, which] will give society access to and command over the inherited knowledge of the ages [should] be the first objective of our scientist" - Vannevar Bush, 1945

# Dendron

![](https://foundation-prod-assetspublic53c57cce-8cpvgjldwysl.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets/logo-256.png)

Dendron is a **hierarchal** note taking tool that **grows** as you do. 

Think of it as a **second brain** to help you make sense of all the information you care about. 

At its core, Dendron is a tool to help you **store and find notes** within **hierarchies**.  Dendron stores notes as plain [markdown](TODO) files with [frontmatter](). 

Dendron is still early and maybe 1% of where it could be. That being said, it is actively being used by the author on a daily (hourly) basis to manage a knowledge base of over 20 thousand notes. 

The **audacious long term goal** is for Dendron to become the **best way to create, understand, and share knowledge**. Please join me in this **journey** and, together, lets **make sense** of this world that we inhabit.

# Principles

1. Keep it simple: Dendron should be a frictionless way to store, connect, and share knowledge.
2. Keep it fast: Dendron should be the fastest way to work with information.
3. Keep it extensible: Dendron should be built with interoperability at its core. 

# Features

To read more about the ideas that inspired Dendron, you can read [this blog post](https://kevinslin.com/organizing/its_not_you_its_your_knowledge_base/).

## Core
- hierarchical search: find nodes by tree traversal
- schemas: optional type system for your notes
- modeless operation: no difference between searching for a file and creating one
