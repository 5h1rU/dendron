# Tips (and Tricks)

We've only scratched the surface of what you can do with Dendron. Because Dendron is built on top of [VSCode](), it comes with all the [extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/extend) already built in to the platform. 

If for some reason, there is functionality that is missing still, you can always build your own or submit an issue on the [Dendron Roadmap](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-roadmap/issues/new)

Meanwhile, if you have any feedback or want to talk about anything note taking or second brain related, you can do so by joining our [discord community]() (like slack but without the message limits) or emailing me directly at `kevin(at)thence.io`.
