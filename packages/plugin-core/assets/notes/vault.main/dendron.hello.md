# Hello...

Congrats, you've just performed your first hierarichal search! 

Hierarichal search is a bit of a misnomer because its more than just searching. You can also use it to create notes that don't exist.

For example, hit `CTRL-P` and enter `dendron.hello.world` into the search bar. This will automatically create a new document. After you've created the document, you can close the tab by clicking the `x` on the tab to get back to this document.

Dendron is all about reducing the friction between you and the information you are about. To continue the tutorial, pick up where you left off
