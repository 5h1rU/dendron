## Fin

We've only scratched the surface of what you can do with Dendron. Because Dendron is built on top of [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), it comes with all the [extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/extend) already built in to the platform. 

If for some reason, there is functionality that is missing still, you can always build your own or submit an issue on the [Dendron Roadmap](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-roadmap/issues/new)

Be sure to checkout the [[dendron.faq]] first to see if your issue is already mentioned.

Meanwhile, if you have any feedback or want to talk about anything note taking or second brain related, you can do so by joining our [discord community](https://discord.gg/6j85zNX) (like slack but without the message limits) or emailing me directly at `kevin(at)thence.io`.
