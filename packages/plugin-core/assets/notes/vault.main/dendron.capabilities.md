# Additional Capabilities

By default, Dendron will initialize your first workspace with the following extensions and features.

By default, Dendron uses [Material Theme High Contrast](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme). You can change this by typing `>Preferences: Color Theme` inside the *Quick Open Bar*.

## Et cetera

Hopefully, this has been enough to give you a sense of what you can do with Dendron. This project is about 1% complete, both in the sense that it is in **preview** but also that there's so much more to build. The north star of this project is to achieve *Vannevar Bush's* original vision - to build a tool of thought that can give humanity *"**access to** and **command over** the inherited **knowledge of the ages**"*. 

If you are reading this, you too, are now part of the journey. Let's take back control of our information and use it to build something better, together!

If for some reason, there is functionality that is missing still, you can always build your own or submit an [issue](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/issues).

Be sure to checkout the [[dendron.faq]] first to see if your issue is already mentioned.

Meanwhile, if you have any feedback or want to talk about anything note taking or second brain related, you can do so by joining our [discord community](https://discord.gg/6j85zNX) (like slack but without the message limits) or emailing me directly at `kevin(at)thence.io`.
