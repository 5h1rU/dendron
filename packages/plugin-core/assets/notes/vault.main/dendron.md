# Welcome to Dendron

![](assets/logo-256.png#center)

Dendron is a **hierarchal** knowledge management tool that **grows** as you do. 

Think of it as a **second brain** to help you make sense of all the information you care about. 

At its core, Dendron helps you **store and find notes**. Dendron does this through [[hierarchies]], [[schemas]], and [markdown](TODO) with [frontmatter](). To read more about the ideas that inspired Dendron, you can read [this blog post](https://kevinslin.com/organizing/its_not_you_its_your_knowledge_base/).

## Dendron Concepts

### Legend

- ðŸš§ these features are still under development

### Workspace
In Dendron, your **workspace** is a folder that contains all your notes. Depending on your operating system, Dendron has a different default location for the **workspace**.

### Vaults ðŸš§
Your workspace is made up of **vaults**. You can think of a vault as a git repository. By default, Dendron creates the *vault.main* folder to store all your notes. Dividing your notes by vaults has some of the following benefits:
- you can separate private notes that you want to keep local (`vault.secret`) from notes you want to sync
- you can import vaults from third parties
- you can publish and collaborate with just the notes in a specific vault

### Hierarchies

Within a vault, your notes are stored **hierarchically** as `.` delimited markdown files. This is similar to how domain names work.

Below is an example of a hierarchal organization scheme within a file system. 

```
â”œâ”€â”€ project1/
â”œâ”€â”€ project1/designs/
â”œâ”€â”€ project1/designs/promotion.png
â”œâ”€â”€ project1/paperwork/
â”œâ”€â”€ project1/paperwork/legal.md
â”œâ”€â”€ project1/tasks/
â”œâ”€â”€ project1/tasks/task1.md
â””â”€â”€ project1/tasks/task2.md
```


In Dendron, the above hierarchy would look like the following

```
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.designs.
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.designs.promotion
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.paperwork.
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.paperwork.legal
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.tasks.
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.tasks.task1
â””â”€â”€ project1.tasks.task2
```

### Schema ðŸš§ 

As you end up creating more notes, it can be hard to keep track of it all. This is why Dendron has **schemas** to help you manage your notes at scale. Think of schemas as an **optional type system** for your notes. They describe the hierarchy of your data and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy.

### Command Bar

The Quick Open bar is how you issue commands to to Dendron. You can bring it open with the following shortcut which will vary depending on your operating system.

### Lookup Bar

The lookup bar is how you interact with notes inside of Dendron. Use it to create, find, and delete notes. To bring it up, use the `CTRL-P` shortcut or open the `Command Bar` and type `> Dendron: Lookup`

## Next

Now that we've covered the major concepts inside Dendron, go to [[dendron.lookup]] to continue the tutorial. You can navigate there by either clicking the link or bringing up the lookup bar using `CTRL-P` and typing `dendron.lookup`
