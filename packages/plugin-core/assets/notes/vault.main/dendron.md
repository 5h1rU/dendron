If you haven't already, you can get a general sense of what dendron is with this video.

## Dendron Concepts

Below are some concepts that make up the core of Dendron. Note that features with ðŸš§ are still under active development and might not be fully implemented.

### Workspace
In Dendron, your **workspace** is the root of where all your files are located. It's definde by the `dendron.rootDir` property and created when you first run `Dendron: Initialize Workspace`

### Vaults ðŸš§
Your workspace is made up of **vaults**. You can think of a vault like  a git repository. By default, Dendron creates a *vault.main* folder when you first initialize a **workspace**. All your notes are stored on a per vault basis.

```
.
â””â”€â”€ workspace
    â”œâ”€â”€ vault.main
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ foo.md
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ foo.one.md
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ foo.two.md
    â””â”€â”€ vault.secret (hypothetical)
        â”œâ”€â”€ secret.one.md
        â””â”€â”€ secret.two.md
```

By default, when you look for notes in dendron, it will search over all vaults.

### Hierarchies

Within a vault, your notes are stored **hierarchically** as `.` delimited markdown files. This is similar to a file tree (see picture below).

```
.
â””â”€â”€ project1/
    â”œâ”€â”€ project1/designs/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ project1/designs/promotion.png
    â”œâ”€â”€ project1/paperwork/
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ project1/paperwork/legal.md
    â””â”€â”€ project1/tasks/
        â”œâ”€â”€ project1/tasks/task1.md
        â””â”€â”€ project1/tasks/task2.md
```


In Dendron, the above hierarchy would look like the following

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.md
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.designs.md
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.designs.promotion.md
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.paperwork.md
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.paperwork.legal.md
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.tasks.md
â”œâ”€â”€ project1.tasks.task1.md
â””â”€â”€ project1.tasks.task2.md
```

The advantage of representing hierarchies in this format is that unlike a folder, a dendron note can represent both a `File` (something that **has data**) and a `Folder` (something that **contains other files**) **simultaneously**. 

### Schema ðŸš§ 

As you end up creating more notes, it can be hard to keep track of it all. This is why Dendron has **schemas** to help you manage your notes at scale. Think of schemas as an **optional type system** for your notes. They describe the hierarchy of your data and are themselves, represented as a hierarchy. 

### Command Bar

The command bar is native to `vscode`. You can use it to run dendron commands, which will all be prefixed with `Dendron:`. You can use the following shortcut to open the command bar.

### Lookup Bar

The lookup bar is how you interact with notes inside of Dendron. Use it to create, find, and delete notes. You can type `> Dendron: Lookup` in the `Command Bar` or use the `CTRL+L` shortcut.
